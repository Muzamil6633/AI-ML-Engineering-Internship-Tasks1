DevelopersHub Corporation 
AI/ML Engineering Internship Tasks 
Due Date: 5th June, 2026
Overview 
As part of your AI/ML Engineering Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation, you are required to 
complete at least 3 out of the following 6 tasks. These tasks are designed to help you build a 
strong foundation in artificial intelligence and machine learning through real-world datasets and 
use cases. 
You will practice skills like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, prompt engineering, 
and even chatbot development — all of which are essential in AI/ML careers. 
Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset 
Objective: 
 Learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand data trends and distributions. 
Dataset: 
 Iris Dataset (CSV format, can be loaded via seaborn or downloaded) 
Instructions: 
● Load the dataset using pandas. ● Print the shape, column names, and the first few rows using .head(). ● Use .info() and .describe() for summary statistics. 
● Visualize the dataset: 
○ Create a scatter plot to show relationships between features. 
○ Use histograms to show value distributions. 
○ Use box plots to identify outliers. 
● Use matplotlib and seaborn for plotting. 
Skills: 
● Data loading and inspection using pandas 
● Descriptive statistics and data exploration 
● Basic plotting and visualization with seaborn and matplotlib 
Task 2: Predict Future Stock Prices (Short-Term) 
Objective: 
 Use historical stock data to predict the next day's closing price. 
Dataset: 
 Stock market data from Yahoo Finance (retrieved using the yfinance Python library) 
Instructions: 
● Select a stock (e.g., Apple, Tesla). 
● Load historical data using the yfinance library. 
● Use features like Open, High, Low, and Volume to predict the next Close price. 
● Train a Linear Regression or Random Forest model. 
● Plot actual vs predicted closing prices for comparison. 
Skills: 
● Time series data handling 
● Regression modeling 
● Data fetching using APIs (yfinance) 
● Plotting predictions vs real data 
Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction 
Objective: 
 Build a model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their health data. 
Dataset: 
 Heart Disease UCI Dataset (available on Kaggle) 
Instructions: 
● Clean the dataset (handle missing values if any). 
● Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends. 
● Train a classification model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree). 
● Evaluate using metrics: accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. 
● Highlight important features affecting prediction. 
Skills: 
● Binary classification 
● Medical data understanding and interpretation 
● Model evaluation using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix 
● Feature importance analysis 
Task 4: General Health Query Chatbot (Prompt 
Engineering Based) 
Objective: 
 Create a chatbot that can answer general health-related questions using an LLM (Large 
Language Model). 
Tools: 
 OpenAI GPT-3.5 via API (or use a free open-source model like Mistral-7B-Instruct on Hugging 
Face) 
Instructions: 
● Build a simple Python script or notebook that sends user queries to an LLM. 
● Use prompt engineering to make the responses friendly and clear (e.g., "Act like a helpful 
medical assistant"). 
● Add safety filters to avoid giving medical advice that could be harmful. 
● Example queries: 
○ "What causes a sore throat?" 
○ "Is paracetamol safe for children?" 
Skills: 
● Prompt design and testing 
● Using APIs for LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) 
● Safety handling in chatbot responses 
● Building simple conversational agents 
Task 5: Mental Health Support Chatbot (Fine-Tuned) 
Objective: 
 Build a basic chatbot that provides supportive and empathetic responses for stress, anxiety, 
and emotional wellness. 
Model Base: 
 DistilGPT2, GPT-Neo, or Mistral (7B) 
Dataset for Fine-Tuning: 
 EmpatheticDialogues (Facebook AI) 
Instructions: 
● Fine-tune a small LLM using Hugging Face’s Trainer API. 
● Train it to respond empathetically using real human dialogues. 
● Ensure the tone is gentle and emotionally supportive. 
● Build a command-line or Streamlit-based interface to test it. 
Skills: 
● Model fine-tuning with Hugging Face Transformers 
● Emotional tone design for safe chatbots 
● Conversation modeling 
● Deployment using CLI or simple web apps 
Task 6: House Price Prediction 
Objective: 
 Predict house prices using property features such as size, bedrooms, and location. 
Dataset: 
 House Price Prediction Dataset (available on Kaggle) 
Instructions: 
● Perform preprocessing on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and 
location. 
● Train a regression model (Linear Regression or Gradient Boosting). 
● Visualize predicted prices compared to actual prices. 
● Evaluate with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RMSE. 
Skills: 
● Regression modeling 
● Feature scaling and selection 
● Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE) 
● Real estate data understanding
